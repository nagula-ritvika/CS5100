1. Open the file - “cryptarithm_solver.pdf” and just run the file using PyCharm or the 	terminal.

2. To give any other cryptarithmetic puzzle as an input to the program, do the following:

	solve(“your input string here: make sure to give spaces between the operator and 	equal to sign”)

3. The output is in the form of a set of mappings and the actual cryptarithm with the letters replaced by digits.
